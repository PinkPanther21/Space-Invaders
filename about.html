        <h1>About Space Invaders</h1>
        <p>
            Space Invaders is a classic arcade game that was released in 1978 and has become a symbol of the golden age of video games. Developed by Tomohiro Nishikado and released by Taito, it was one of the first shooting games to gain widespread popularity. Players control a spaceship and must defeat waves of alien invaders that move towards the bottom of the screen.

            The game's success led to numerous sequels, spin-offs, and adaptations, making it a cornerstone of retro gaming culture. Its pixelated graphics, iconic sound effects, and addictive gameplay have made it a timeless classic for both old-school and modern gamers.
